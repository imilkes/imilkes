# 🌞 🌴 🌬️ 🌻 bio ✨ 🔥 🌊 🫀 (there is no meaning in words or order of words) 

*There is always an echo in the akasha. Grateful with Spirit for this reincarnation and opportunity to be on Earth at this present time. *

I am ilana, a fullstack product designer and tech-driven founder with +11 years of experience across industries like edTech, govtech, climate fintech, web3 and financial markets. I like building solutions that improve or disrupt (for the better) our societies and 'the collective', unleashing human potential at its full capacity. In this lifetime, I realized love is a quantum leap and everyone is interconnected. Our choices and intentions, while in system loops and parallel realities, are evolution opportunities for our souls to evolve and fulfill our agreements and life purposes. While I am not navigating mediums, armies, psychics and hypnotists, I like to create, travel and grow. Always appreciative of the groups I incarnate with. Thanks to all because our projections are our spiritual evolution. Giver. It's been 'proven'. .

<b> 🃏 Transits And Lessons. Mission Accomplished:</b>
                                    
         🫀💎 Spiritual integrity and actions are always registered regardless of the system participants, the system intentions and the system 'state'.
         🪞 Your Life Review is your life review. People will misjudge you anyways. Be true to who you are and what you believe in.
         ✨ Information from Spirit is a gift. Knowing something and choosing love despite it all is not an act of self-sabotage or going backwards.
         🫀 Creating from love at the core is ever-lasting, regardless of what is done to the creation or the creator. There is always an echo in the akasha.
         🔮 Sometimes you elevate yourself and others by choosing from love and freewill. Again, your life review is your life review.
         🔪🚶🏼‍➡️the man seeing the women suns be crashed by left-inclined trains (from behind) is eventually revealed by the cosmos.
         🫀 It's all an evolving spiritual process. Love guides, the roles evolve = the essence stays.
         🫀💎 ACCESS. GIVERS. By choosing the 'source' I chose my 'past life' within this lifetime, which, paradoxically, is the future. 
         
         👵🏼 Androgenous sun women could be considered. They are the realest in this reincarnation (updated).
         🤍 Access to 'Spirit' does not equate to 'Spiritually Advanced'. I hope to always be learning. Learning is a gift and a sign of growth.

<b> Beliefs, values, experiences and what I know to be true </b>
   
       🌹 I believe in the power of integrity, the integrity of intentions and the spirit world. 
       🏄‍♀️ I know Love is the greatest force, beyond time and space.
       🌠 We are souls visiting Gaia, temporarily, to create, reinvent ourselves and learn.
       🤍 Before incarnating, our soul agrees to experience lessons during the lifetime.
       🧮 Spiritual integrity is what we carry to future lifetimes - forever.
       🌊 Receiving help or helping others are not signs of weakness or trauma. 
       🛰️ I appreciate Self-Agency, Independence, Truth and Kindness.
       📝 There is always something to learn. 
       🌹 Your life review is your life review. Ego will always question, especially if in the 'standards of worth' there are things like 'motherhood'. 
       🤍 Forever doubted by this planet's participants. Thank You Anyways And Always!
